## Background
The **International Development Association (IDA) is the World Bank’s concessional arm** that provides low-interest loans and grants to the world’s poorest countries to support sustainable development and reduce poverty.

This project leverages monthly historical snapshots, available from April 2011 onward, to examine all credits, grants, and guarantees approved between 2011 and 2025. The analysis highlights key countries and uncovers trends in funding commitments and disbursements across IDA-supported projects. These insights aim to support strategic decisions made by stakeholders in the Operations and Finance departments.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

* **Funding** - Evaluation of funding commitments over time

* **Disbursements** -

* **Key Countries** -

## Data Processing
The **data includes monthly snapshots of credits, grants, and guarantees of IDA-supported projects.** A total of 1,422,052 rows were uploaded to a SQL database. After preprocessing for duplicates, null values, data types, and corrupted entries, 361,814 rows corresponding to approved projects between 2011 and 2025 were retained for analysis. Final datasets with selected columns were then created to streamline Tableau visualizations.
